Tigray Genocide Background and Context:
The conflict in Tigray, Ethiopia, also referred as the ‘Tigray genocidal war’ is a complex and highly contentious issue that began in November 2020. It involves multiple actors, including the Ethiopian federal government, Amhara special forces and militias, other regional forces, foreign forces (Eritrean, Somali), and middle eastern superpower countries in one side against TPLF led the people of Tigray in one side in which the people of Tigray were fighting for their survival and the other despotic groups were fighting for power struggle. Several political elites and scholars traced the conflict to a power struggle between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the TPLF, which had been the dominant political forces in Ethiopia for nearly three decades until Abiy took office in 2018. Tensions escalated when the Tigray regional government defied the federal government by holding its own regional election in September 2020, which the constitutionally illegal central government deemed the regional election illegal. In response, the Ethiopian government launched a military offensive in early November 2020 in the name of law enforcement and aiming to remove the TPLF from power. The genocidal war continued for more than two years and stopped in late 2022 upon the signing of permanent cessation of hostilities between the Federal government and the TPLF in November 2022 in Pretoria, South Africa.
